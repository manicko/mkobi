1. **English Only**  
   All comments, logs, docstrings, error messages, and documentation must be in clear English.

2. **Production Code is King**  
   If tests conflict with architecture or business logic — fix or remove the tests. Never distort production code for tests.

3. **Strict Separation of Concerns**  
   Enforce clear boundaries between UI, API, business logic, and data layers.

4. **Single Responsibility**  
   Modules, services, components, and functions must be small and focused on one thing.

5. **Avoid Overengineering**  
   Prefer simple, obvious, and maintainable solutions over complex abstractions.

6. **Composition Over Inheritance**  
   Prefer composition in both backend and frontend.

7. **Follow Existing Patterns**  
    Respect and follow established patterns and conventions in the codebase. Do not introduce new abstractions without strong justification.   

8. **Meaningful & Consistent Naming**  
    Use clear, concise, and consistent names for files, functions, components, and variables.

9. **Type Safety Everywhere**  
   Use strict TypeScript on frontend and Pydantic v2 + type hints on backend. Share types via OpenAPI. Avoid `any` completely.

10. **StrEnum for All Constants**  
   All fixed values and settings must use `Enum` or `StrEnum` instead of dicts and lists. Keep them separately in models. 

11. **Pydantic**  
    All models and validation use Pydantic v2 (DTO/validation layer at system boundaries: bot input, settings schemas, future API). Django ORM remains the persistence layer for standard CRUD operations. 

12. **No `print()` Statements**  
    Use proper logging: `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`.

13. Use database migrations for all schema changes
    Database structure must be versioned and reproducible.

14. Keep documentation updated continuously
    Architecture decisions, setup instructions, and API usage must always stay current.
15. **Small Modules and Functions**
    Short, focused files and functions give higher ROI in maintenance — they are
    easier to edit, review, and less prone to corruption.
